# Youtube-Transcription-Downloader
This script downloads transcripts for all videos in YouTube channels. It creates a separate folder for each channel and organizes files into subdirectories. Downloads are processed with rate limiting to avoid YouTube IP bans. Files that already exist will be skipped, allowing you to resume or update channels.
