YouTube Channel Transcript Downloader
================================================================================

This script downloads transcripts for videos on YouTube channels or individual videos.
It creates a separate folder for each channel and organizes files into subdirectories.
Downloads are processed with rate limiting to avoid YouTube IP bans.
Files that already exist will be skipped, allowing you to resume or update channels.

USAGE:
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py [options] <channel_or_video_url(s)>

EXAMPLES:
  # Download transcript for a single YouTube video
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ -en
  # Short URL also works
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ -en
  # Multiple URLs also works
  Youtube.Transcribe.py https://youtu.be/aDkzgTWhVY4 https://youtu.be/3ZC1iqYfFGU -en
  # Download English transcripts from a channel
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-lHJZR3Gqxm24_Vd_AJ5Yw -en
  # Download multiple languages
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py https://youtube.com/c/channel1 -en -es -fr
  # Download all available languages
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py https://youtube.com/c/channel1 -all
  # Download only TXT files (no JSON)
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py https://youtube.com/c/channel1 -en -txt
  # Download only JSON files (no TXT)
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py https://youtube.com/c/channel1 -en -json
  # Faster downloads (may increase risk of IP ban)
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py https://youtube.com/c/channel1 -en -delay 1 -workers 5
  # Slower, safer downloads (to prevent IP bans)
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py https://youtube.com/c/channel1 -en -delay 3 -workers 2
  # Download from multiple channels
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py https://youtube.com/c/channel1 https://youtube.com/c/channel2 -en
  # Download from channels listed in a file (one URL per line or comma-separated)
  python Youtube.Transcribe.py -f channels.txt -en

OPTIONS:
  -f, --file FILE    Read channel URLs from a text file (one per line or comma-separated)
  -LANG              Language code for transcripts (e.g., -en for English)
                     Multiple language codes can be specified (e.g., -en -es -fr)
  -all               Download all available languages for each video
  -txt               Download only TXT files (no JSON)
  -json              Download only JSON files (no TXT)
  -delay N           Delay between API requests in seconds (default: 1.5)
                     Higher values reduce risk of IP bans but slow downloads
  -workers N         Number of concurrent downloads (default: 3, range: 1-10)
                     Lower values reduce risk of IP bans but slow downloads
  -h, --help         Show this help message

RATE LIMITING:
  To avoid YouTube IP bans, this script implements several protection measures:
  1. Request delays: Controlled delay between API calls (adjust with -delay)
  2. Random jitter: Â±20% randomness added to each delay to avoid pattern detection
  3. Limited concurrency: Restricted parallel downloads (adjust with -workers)
  4. Smart retries: Automatic detection of non-retryable errors (age-restricted videos, etc.)
  5. Exponential backoff: Increasingly longer delays after rate limit errors
  6. Error skipping: No retry for videos that cannot have transcripts (subtitles disabled, etc.)

  RECOMMENDED SETTINGS:
  - Normal usage: Default values (-delay 1.5 -workers 3)
  - If IP banned:
    1. Switch to very slow settings (-delay 5 -workers 1) until ban is lifted
    2. After ban is lifted, continue with these slow settings for 5-7 minutes
    3. Then reduce to half your original speed (double delay, halve workers)
    4. If banned again, repeat the halving process until bans stop permanently
    Example: If original settings were -delay 1 -workers 6, after recovery use
             -delay 2 -workers 3, then -delay 4 -workers 2 if banned again

FILE ORGANIZATION:
  Files are organized based on languages detected and requested:
  - Single language mode (when only one language exists or is requested):
    ./transcripts/[Channel Name]/json/[Video Title]_[VideoID]_[lang].json
    ./transcripts/[Channel Name]/[Video Title]_[VideoID]_[lang].txt
  - Multiple language mode (triggered when):
    * Multiple languages are requested in the command
    * Multiple languages already exist in the folder
    * A new language is requested that doesn't match existing files
    In this mode, files are organized as:
    ./transcripts/[Channel Name]/[lang]/json/[Video Title]_[VideoID]_[lang].json
    ./transcripts/[Channel Name]/[lang]/[Video Title]_[VideoID]_[lang].txt

NOTES:
  - If no language is specified, your system language will be used
  - If system language cannot be determined, English will be used
  - Use Ctrl+C to properly terminate the script
  - The script will automatically reorganize files when switching to multiple language mode

FILE FORMAT:
  The channel url file can contain URLs in any of these formats:
  - One URL per line
  - Comma-separated URLs
  - Comma with spaces between URLs
  Example file content:
    https://youtube.com/channel/UC123, https://youtube.com/c/channel2
    https://youtube.com/user/someuser
